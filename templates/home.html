            <h2>Trauma Stages in Children</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Stage 1: Denial</h3>
                    <p>
                        Characteristics: Children in this stage may refuse to acknowledge the trauma. They might act as if nothing happened or insist that the traumatic event was not serious. This denial can be a coping mechanism to protect themselves from the emotional pain of the experience.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Stage 2: Bargaining</h3>
                    <p>
                        Characteristics: In the bargaining stage, children might try to make deals or promises to change the situation. They may believe that by doing something differently, they can prevent the trauma from recurring or reverse its effects. This stage often involves a lot of "what if" and "if only" thinking.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Stage 3: Sadness</h3>
                    <p>
                        Characteristics: This stage is marked by deep sadness and emotional pain. Children may feel overwhelmed by their emotions, cry frequently, or withdraw from activities and people they used to enjoy. It's a natural response to processing the reality of their trauma.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Stage 4: Acceptance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Characteristics: Acceptance does not mean that the trauma is forgotten or that it no longer causes pain. Instead, it signifies that the child is beginning to come to terms with what happened and is starting to move forward. They may begin to integrate the experience into their life story and find ways to cope with the memories and emotions.
